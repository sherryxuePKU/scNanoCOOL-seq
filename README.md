
## Overview

scNanoCOOL-seq is a sequencing method based on nanopore sequencing platform, which involves **bisulfite conversion** and adopt a **single-barcode PCR amplification** strategy. Up to now, its DNA fragments is approximately **900 bp** in length. 
As shown below, the experimental process of scNanoCOOL-seq mainly includes: 
1) **Preprocess**: cell lysis in a gentle way and in vitro methylation by DNA transferase M.CviPI enzyme, followed by nucleocytoplasmic separation of single cells;
2) **DNA methylome**: the nucleus of single cells is processed with single-linker amplification after bisulfite treatment and PBAT-like library construction and is used for single-molecule sequencing on the nanopore platform;
3) **RNA transcriptome**: the cytoplasmic part of the single cell is used for scRNA-seq library construction (optimized STRT-seq).
